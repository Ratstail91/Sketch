The list of lines should act like a que, since I don't want too much backlog,
the lines nearer to the top of the que should be deleted.

using a deque might be the best option.

Terminal:
	KeyDown(SDLKey)
	KeyUp(SDLKey)
	
	input field
	list of lines
	
	delete lines at the top of the list
	delete lines at the bottom of the list
end

Some sort of time delay for the backspace in Terminal?

-------------------------

for each keypress, add that key onto the "input field"
when "enter" is pressed, push that line onto the BACK of the deque
in the draw event, iterate through each line and draw it to the screen.

-------------------------

terminal utilities:

drawing the terminal:

args: terminal, dest, font, size, rect, line count

adjust the terminal
fill the background rect
draw each line
draw the input line

-------------------------

TerminalDraw(Terminal, pScreen, ...
TerminalDoString(Terminal, L)
