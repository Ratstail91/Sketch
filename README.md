Sketch is a simple, lightweight 2D tile map editor, written with C++, SDL and lua. The core is written in C++ with graphics and input handled by SDL. Lua scripts are used by the editor to process the map in various ways such as custom saving and loading formats, random terrain generation or extended functionality.  
This project is only in early development; therefore many (or any) features are currently missing.
