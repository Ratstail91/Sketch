Sketch is a lightweight extensible map editor for 2D tile based games. Lua is used to extend the core of the editor and edit the maps in ways such as custom file formats and procedural generation.

## Feature List

## Dependencies

## Instructions

* This project uses C++11, which is available via GNU (or MinGW) 4.7, or Visual Studio 2012. Personally, I'm using MinGW 4.7.2.
* I'm trying to keep this as IDE agnostic as possible, so if you use an IDE, please add it's files to .gitignore.
* To build this project, ensure that the dependancies are installed, and simply run `make` in the root directory.
