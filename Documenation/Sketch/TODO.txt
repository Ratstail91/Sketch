The basic functionality is the most important. If I can get that going 
(and a few standard scripts) the editor might reach it's first milestone.

Basic Functionality:
*	Clean interface
*	Smooth, intuitive controls
>	Custom layered map sizes
-	Map Pagination
-	Multiple tilesets per map
end

Scripts And Filters:
*	Standard brush filters
>	Standard saving/loading
>	Standard lua scripts
-	Custom saving/loading
-	Custom brush filters
-	Custom Lua scripts
end

Extended Functionality:
-	Collision map
-	Position markers
-	Waypoints
end
