The list of lines should act like a que, since I don't want too much backlog,
the lines nearer to the top of the que should be deleted.

using a deque might be the best option.

Terminal:
	KeyDown(SDLKey)
	KeyUp(SDLKey)
	
	input field
	list of lines
	
	delete lines at the top of the list
	delete lines at the bottom of the list
end

-------------------------

for each keypress, add that key onto the "input field"

when "enter" is pressed, push that line onto the BACK of the deque

in the draw event, iterate through each line and draw it to the screen.
