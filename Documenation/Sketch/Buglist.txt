problems with implementing the drectory system:
	The filepath and filenames for startup.lua & shutdown.lua are hardcoded
	C++:Tileset::Load() has to strip the possible filepath from the filename
	lua:dir["map"] is built into lua:standard_save() and lua:standard_load() functions
	
	be mindful with directories, I don't know how many other issues are hiding here.

The current font file is missing some punctuation characters, including quote
marks.
